# BeatSphere

## Description 
BeatSphere is a MERN Stack React application, designed to allow users to discover the most popular songs around the world in each country. This application simplifies the discovery of top songs by letting the user select a country around the world and show the top 5 songs in that country. The user can then search and listen to the songs they discover on the Spotify Player page although this requires a Spotify Premium account.

2. Install Dependencies: Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory and execute npm install. This command will install all the dependencies required for BeatSphere to run smoothly.
3. Set up dotenv variables for API and change some routes to localhost to interact with the application through local server.
4. Seed the Application: To populate the application with initial data, run npm seed in your terminal. This step is crucial for setting up a mock environment that resembles the actual application.
5. Start the Application: Launch the application by entering npm run develop in your terminal. This command runs both the server and client sides concurrently, thanks to the integrated functionality of the concurrently package.
6. Access the Local Version: After running the above command, a link to localhost:3000 will appear in your terminal. Clicking this link will take you directly to the BeatSphere landing page, allowing you to interact with your local version of the application.
